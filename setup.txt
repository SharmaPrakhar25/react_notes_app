A context of a function is the value of this for that function -- i.e.
the object in which the function is called as a method.
var x = {
    value: 10,
    a: function(){
        // so the context of this function is x.
    }
}

When you start having functions, you might have different levels of your program and this represents where you are,
what object called the function.

const coffee = {
  strong: true,
  info: function() {
    console.log(`The coffee is ${this.strong ? '' : 'not '}strong`)
  },
}
coffee.info() // The coffee is strong


//For routing 
npm install --save react-router-dom
